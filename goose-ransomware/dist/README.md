Woweeee... another client was struck by similar malware 3 months after our 
initial finding of goldfish-ransomware. We managed to get a sample of this one,
which we've named "goose-ransomware".

It seems similar to the previous one. The ransomware author seems to be getting
better and learning from their mistakes. This one is a lot harder to understand.

We really need this file decrypted for the client though, can you help us?
